Lulzbot TAZ re-imaginings

So many tweaks, and yet I could never get the print quality I wanted.  Fundamental shortcomings are related to a lack of rigidity in the frame, z-axis, extruder, linear bearings, etc.  
I reached a crossroads; fabricate and install the several excellent redesigned parts by 1013

OR  
Tear it all down and reimagine it all from the start.  

My next task is choosing a design path -- please comment!!!!  

I will either follow a design strategy that limits itself to using the standardized frame and rail components from a fully assembled, from-the-factory TAZ (I may increase the number of frame or rail pieces but will use the standard lengths)  
or I will design without constraining myself to the stock frame and rail pieces.  

In either case, I will utilize as much of the stock hardware as possible.  Where significant performance improvements can be achieved for reasonable cost (such as linear bearings, idlers, zero stops) I will substitute parts.  

Anyway, let me know what you think.  
Hopefully more to come.....
